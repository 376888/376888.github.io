Coming from a background of .Net it was a little troublesome at first because lets face it JavaScript was a pain when I started learning it and it was a chore at best. Within the past year I have begun embracing it and all its odd complexities. Now I am just fascinated with its flexibility and popularity. Here are some of the ways I am learning it.</p>\n<h2>Learning by solving real-world problems;</h2>\n<p>I was trying to decide how I can get some real-world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> code out there when I came across <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a>. I want to eventually create a side business and this was my first real attempt to “get out there” and do some work. So I decided to go full in on Fiverr and I did for a few months then I had to stop using it because of personal reasons. I learned so much by working on small tasks in Google apps like Google Sheets, which uses JavaScript as its scripting language.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/articles/" target="_blank">Google Sheets Tutorials</a> - This is Google’s site for learning scripting in Sheets. Great resource.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.mousewhisperer.co.uk/drivebunny/" target="_blank">Drive Bunny</a> - I used this site a lot when I was working consistently in Google Sheets and needed some quick answers.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.labnol.org/" target="_blank">Digital Inspiration by Amit Agarwal</a> - This guy is a genius and has a lot of great work out there to share with the world, go here if you want answers!
