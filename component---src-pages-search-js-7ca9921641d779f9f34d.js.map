Defaults to 7.\n\t* - getRankingInfo: if set to 1, the result hits will contain ranking\n\t* information in _rankingInfo attribute.\n\t* - aroundLatLng: search for entries around a given\n\t* latitude/longitude (specified as two floats separated by a comma).\n\t*   For example aroundLatLng=47.316669,5.016670).\n\t*   You can specify the maximum distance in meters with the aroundRadius parameter (in meters)\n\t*   and the precision for ranking with aroundPrecision\n\t*   (for example if you set aroundPrecision=100, two objects that are distant of\n\t*   less than 100m will be considered as identical for \"geo\" ranking parameter).\n\t*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n\t*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n\t* - insideBoundingBox: search entries inside a given area defined by the two extreme points\n\t* of a rectangle (defined by 4 floats: p1Lat,p1Lng,p2Lat,p2Lng).\n\t*   For example insideBoundingBox=47.3165,4.9665,47.3424,5.0201).\n\t*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n\t*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n\t* - numericFilters: a string that contains the list of numeric filters you want to\n\t* apply separated by a comma.\n\t*   The syntax of one filter is `attributeName` followed by `operand` followed by `value`.\n\t*   Supported operands are `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>` and `>=`.\n\t*   You can have multiple conditions on one attribute like for example numericFilters=price>100,price<1000.\n\t*   You can also use an array (for example numericFilters: [\"price>100\",\"price<1000\"]).\n\t* - tagFilters: filter the query by a set of tags. You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n\t*   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n\t*   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n\t*   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n\t*   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n\t*   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n\t* - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n\t*   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n\t*   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n\t*   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n\t* - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n\t*   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n\t*   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n\t*   can be used in this parameter.\n\t*   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n\t* - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n\t*    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n\t*    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n\t*    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix. This option is not recommended.\n\t* - optionalWords: a string that contains the list of words that should\n\t* be considered as optional when found in the query.\n\t*   Comma separated and array are accepted.\n\t* - distinct: If set to 1, enable the distinct feature (disabled by default)\n\t* if the attributeForDistinct index setting is set.\n\t*   This feature is similar to the SQL \"distinct\" keyword: when enabled\n\t*   in a query with the distinct=1 parameter,\n\t*   all hits containing a duplicate value for the attributeForDistinct attribute are removed from results.\n\t*   For example, if the chosen attribute is show_name and several hits have\n\t*   the same value for show_name, then only the best\n\t*   one is kept and others are removed.\n\t* - restrictSearchableAttributes: List of attributes you want to use for\n\t* textual search (must be a subset of the attributesToIndex index setting)\n\t* either comma separated or as an array\n\t* @param {function} [callback] the result callback called with two arguments:\n\t*  error: null or Error('message'). If false, the content contains the error.\n\t*  content: the server answer that contains the list of results.\n\t*/\n\tIndexCore.prototype.search = buildSearchMethod('query');\n\t\n\t/*\n\t* -- BETA --\n\t* Search a record similar to the query inside the index using XMLHttpRequest request (Using a POST query to\n\t* minimize number of OPTIONS queries: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).\n\t*\n\t* @param {string} [query] the similar query\n\t* @param {object} [args] (optional) if set, contains an object with query parameters.\n\t*   All search parameters are supported (see search function), restrictSearchableAttributes and facetFilters\n\t*   are the two most useful to restrict the similar results and get more relevant content\n\t*/\n\tIndexCore.prototype.similarSearch = buildSearchMethod('similarQuery');\n\t\n\t/*\n\t* Browse index content.

The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {Function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar Promise$1 = function () {\n\t  function Promise(resolver) {\n\t    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t    this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t    if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function(user){\n\t    // user is available\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Chaining\n\t  --------\n\t   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return user.name;\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    return 'default name';\n\t  }).then(function (userName) {\n\t    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t    // will be `'default name'`\n\t  });\n\t   findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Assimilation\n\t  ------------\n\t   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t  }).then(function (comments) {\n\t    // The user's comments are now available\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t  }).then(function (comments) {\n\t    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // If `findCommentsByAuthor`

page\n\t * is in relation to the website or web application’s hierarchy.\n\t * In terms of usability, using a breadcrumb reduces the number of actions a visitor needs to take in\n\t * order to get to a higher-level page.\n\t *\n\t * If you want to select a specific refinement for your Breadcrumb component, you will need to\n\t * use a [Virtual Hierarchical Menu](https://community.algolia.com/react-instantsearch/guide/Virtual_widgets.html)\n\t * and set its defaultRefinement that will be then used by the Breadcrumb.\n\t *\n\t * @name Breadcrumb\n\t * @kind widget\n\t * @requirements Breadcrumbs are used for websites with a large amount of content organised in a hierarchical manner.\n\t * The typical example is an e-commerce website which has a large variety of products grouped into logical categories\n\t * (with categories, subcategories which also have subcategories).To use this widget, your attributes must be formatted in a specific way.\n\t *\n\t * Keep in mind that breadcrumbs shouldn’t replace effective primary navigation menus:\n\t * it is only an alternative way to navigate around the website.\n\t *\n\t * If, for instance, you would like to have a breadcrumb of categories, objects in your index\n\t * should be formatted this way:\n\t *\n\t * ```json\n\t * {\n\t *   \"categories.lvl0\": \"products\",\n\t *   \"categories.lvl1\": \"products > fruits\",\n\t *   \"categories.lvl2\": \"products > fruits > citrus\"\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * It's also possible to provide more than one path for each level:\n\t *\n\t * ```json\n\t * {\n\t *   \"categories.lvl0\": [\"products\", \"goods\"],\n\t *   \"categories.lvl1\": [\"products > fruits\", \"goods > to eat\"]\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * All attributes passed to the `attributes` prop must be present in \"attributes for faceting\"\n\t * on the Algolia dashboard or configured as `attributesForFaceting` via a set settings call to the Algolia API.\n\t *\n\t * @propType {array.<string>} attributes - List of attributes to use to generate the hierarchy of the menu. See the example for the convention to follow\n\t * @propType {node} [separator='>'] -  Symbol used for separating hyperlinks\n\t * @propType {string} [rootURL=null] - The originating page (homepage)\n\t * @propType {function} [transformItems] - Function to modify the items being displayed, e.g. for filtering or sorting them. Takes an items as parameter and expects it back in return\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb - the root div of the widget\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb--noRefinement - the root div of the widget when there is no refinement\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb-list - the list of all breadcrumb items\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb-item - the breadcrumb navigation item\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb-item--selected - the selected breadcrumb item\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb-separator - the separator of each breadcrumb item\n\t * @themeKey ais-Breadcrumb-link - the clickable breadcrumb element\n\t * @translationKey rootLabel - The root's label.

Defaults to 7.\n* - getRankingInfo: if set to 1, the result hits will contain ranking\n* information in _rankingInfo attribute.\n* - aroundLatLng: search for entries around a given\n* latitude/longitude (specified as two floats separated by a comma).\n*   For example aroundLatLng=47.316669,5.016670).\n*   You can specify the maximum distance in meters with the aroundRadius parameter (in meters)\n*   and the precision for ranking with aroundPrecision\n*   (for example if you set aroundPrecision=100, two objects that are distant of\n*   less than 100m will be considered as identical for \"geo\" ranking parameter).\n*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n* - insideBoundingBox: search entries inside a given area defined by the two extreme points\n* of a rectangle (defined by 4 floats: p1Lat,p1Lng,p2Lat,p2Lng).\n*   For example insideBoundingBox=47.3165,4.9665,47.3424,5.0201).\n*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n* - numericFilters: a string that contains the list of numeric filters you want to\n* apply separated by a comma.\n*   The syntax of one filter is `attributeName` followed by `operand` followed by `value`.\n*   Supported operands are `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>` and `>=`.\n*   You can have multiple conditions on one attribute like for example numericFilters=price>100,price<1000.\n*   You can also use an array (for example numericFilters: [\"price>100\",\"price<1000\"]).\n* - tagFilters: filter the query by a set of tags. You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n*   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n*   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n*   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n* - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n*   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n*   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n*   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n* - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n*   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n*   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n*   can be used in this parameter.\n*   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n* - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n*    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n*    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n*    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix. This option is not recommended.\n* - optionalWords: a string that contains the list of words that should\n* be considered as optional when found in the query.\n*   Comma separated and array are accepted.\n* - distinct: If set to 1, enable the distinct feature (disabled by default)\n* if the attributeForDistinct index setting is set.\n*   This feature is similar to the SQL \"distinct\" keyword: when enabled\n*   in a query with the distinct=1 parameter,\n*   all hits containing a duplicate value for the attributeForDistinct attribute are removed from results.\n*   For example, if the chosen attribute is show_name and several hits have\n*   the same value for show_name, then only the best\n*   one is kept and others are removed.\n* - restrictSearchableAttributes: List of attributes you want to use for\n* textual search (must be a subset of the attributesToIndex index setting)\n* either comma separated or as an array\n* @param {function} [callback] the result callback called with two arguments:\n*  error: null or Error('message').

For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nfunction race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject$1(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n

Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped\n * with `_#value`.\n *\n * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be\n * enabled using `_.chain`.\n *\n * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n *\n * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.\n * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids\n * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of\n * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only\n * one argument.

usability, using a breadcrumb reduces the number of actions a visitor needs to take in\n * order to get to a higher-level page.\n *\n * If you want to select a specific refinement for your Breadcrumb component, you will need to\n * use a [Virtual Hierarchical Menu](https://community.algolia.com/react-instantsearch/guide/Virtual_widgets.html)\n * and set its defaultRefinement that will be then used by the Breadcrumb.\n *\n * @name Breadcrumb\n * @kind widget\n * @requirements Breadcrumbs are used for websites with a large amount of content organised in a hierarchical manner.\n * The typical example is an e-commerce website which has a large variety of products grouped into logical categories\n * (with categories, subcategories which also have subcategories).To use this widget, your attributes must be formatted in a specific way.\n *\n * Keep in mind that breadcrumbs shouldn’t replace effective primary navigation menus:\n * it is only an alternative way to navigate around the website.\n *\n * If, for instance, you would like to have a breadcrumb of categories, objects in your index\n * should be formatted this way:\n *\n * ```json\n * {\n *   \"categories.lvl0\": \"products\",\n *   \"categories.lvl1\": \"products > fruits\",\n *   \"categories.lvl2\": \"products > fruits > citrus\"\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * It's also possible to provide more than one path for each level:\n *\n * ```json\n * {\n *   \"categories.lvl0\": [\"products\", \"goods\"],\n *   \"categories.lvl1\": [\"products > fruits\", \"goods > to eat\"]\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * All attributes passed to the `attributes` prop must be present in \"attributes for faceting\"\n * on the Algolia dashboard or configured as `attributesForFaceting` via a set settings call to the Algolia API.\n *\n * @propType {array.<string>} attributes - List of attributes to use to generate the hierarchy of the menu.
